# RugbyScore
Displays scores on the Weigall Scoreboard.

## Production
In production, this is run as a webpage in firefox on a desktop with a HDMI connection to the scoreboard. It opens a pop-up box, which the user can make full screen, at a resolution of `2048x1152`. This resolution is a lie, as the Weigall board scales it down to somewhere around `196x540` (not sure).
